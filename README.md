## Overview

This is a simple weather app that will retrieve weather information from the openweather api.
The aim of this app is to display different capital cities weather. Although the data used for input is not exhausting, it is still enough to show the simplicity and difficult elements of the app. 
The app will be build with the flask framework as backend, and bootstrap for frontend. I hope you find motivation especially as a python beginner, and just build stuff.
